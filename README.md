# HalloweenProject
Halloween project for engineering

3 finger robot claw using servos, speakers, ultrasonic sensor and LED

How it works:
If a new object is detected from the ultrasonic sensor, the 3 fingers will open and close, the speaker will play a distressing noise and the led will flash on and off
(Assuming everything is wired correctly on the arduino)
